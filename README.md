# Author's notes
  I have implemented two version of program, one is for player against computer,
  another is for player vs player, but due to being afread of collecting too 
  much data, we choose to use P vs C, since the amount of data is twice than
  P vs P, and the behavior of computer is what we can control, and this will be
  the key to simplified experiments and to conclude more persuasive results.
