# When Moral Meets Interest
A web game client/server written in node.js to collect data for the final project of Psychinformatics and Neuroinformatics, Fall 2015
We try to model a game to find out how people will react considering their own interest and moral.

## Game Rule Descriptions
There are two players in each game. In every round, one of the user will get an amount of money and can decide how much he/she wants to give to the other player. And the next round's money will depend on how much money you give out. A game has either 3 or 5 rounds.

## To start with
  Download nodejs for any platform you use.
  You can modify the IP address and port to run on your PC or server.
  Then simply type 
    > node index.js

## Author's notes
  I have implemented two version of program, one is for player against computer,
  another is for player vs player, but due to being afread of collecting too 
  much data, we choose to use P vs C, since the amount of data is twice than
  P vs P, and the behavior of computer is what we can control, and this will be
  the key to simplified experiments and to conclude more persuasive results.
